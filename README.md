# PassageWay_GithubVersion

Code for picture manipulating web application I created.  Application used to be hosted at Passageway-app.com but has been taken down due to AWS fees.  Application can still run locally using flask run.

This version uses SQLite (I have other versions using PostGres).  The application is designed to run with minimal cost on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  Application can be deployed with docker or uploaded directley to AWS.

Fonts file was too large to upload to Github,but a smaller folder containing 32 fonts (down from 500) is included.  The file needs a Flikr API key and a little bit of adjustment but runs well locally and moderately well as a cloud application.

Screenshots of the application and an edited photo example are shown below.
