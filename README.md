# PassageWay_Github_Version

Code for picture manipulating web application I created named PassageWay.  Passageway.com

This version uses SQLite (I have others using PostGres).  The application is designed to run with minimal cost on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  Application can be deployed with docker or uploaded directley to AWS.

Fonts file was too large to upload to Github.
